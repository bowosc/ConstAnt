ConstAnt is a near-finished project centered around the idea of a search engine that enables a user to search a mathematical expression by the result, kind of like a reverse calculator.

The data, thousands of numbers (constants), is initially generated automatically. From here, users have the ability to add their own constants to the database. Users can also like and comment under other's constants, creating a set of useful "trivia" pertaining to each of the many constants searchable on the site. The final result here will be a wide database of numbers and their properties, trivia, and arithmatic relationships with other numbers.

ConstAnt uses a Flask backend with a lot of SQLAlchemy ORM.
