        PURPOSE

        CONTENT
        ConstAnt is a database of numbers (or, "constants") and numerical relationships. 
        It catalogues data including names, traits, and expressions that evaluate to each constant. 
        The base set of data is automatically generated, but ConstAnt is designed to grow via user contributions.
